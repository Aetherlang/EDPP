     1. Your task is to code up two machines working in parallel dimensions. By the setup, they are very old, ancient even, so they can randomly stop for some time. One of these machines, likes very small numbers, while the other one likes very big ones. There is an X in ether that they are fighting about: the first one always tries to substract 1 from it, while the second one always does the opposite. You should also code up the log for this simulation so that one can watch them fight for eternity in real-time.

     2. Now there's a third machine added to them that tries to divide X by 2 and make it closer to 0. This third machine is a bit older so the chance of it breaking is twice bigger. It is also a cheater so once X is not an integer after its division, it simply truncates it to the closest smaller integer. Oh wait, there's also another one coming... It seems to be the oldest one and it only likes even numbers, so it only changes X when it's odd.
